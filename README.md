# ml_repo
This Repo contains a machine learning model developed for the Samay Machine Learning test. 
The ML model classifies respiratory diseases using MFCC features from Kaggle lung sound dataset.

Please take a look at the jupyter file [Samay_ML_test2.ipynb](https://github.com/jdbj89/ml_repo/blob/main/Samay_ML_test2.ipynb), where each step of the process is detailed or please see the [pdf_file](https://github.com/jdbj89/ml_repo/blob/main/Samay_Test_Results_JoseBolanos.pdf) if you want to see a summary of the project results.
